# Simulating-a-container-terminal-using-SimPy
This project simulates the operations of a container terminal using SimPy. The simulation models vessel arrivals, berthing, and the unloading of containers using quay cranes and trucks. With limited resources such as berths, cranes, and trucks, the terminal handles the logistics of container movement efficiently. Each event is logged with timestamps to visualize the workflow. The simulation helps in understanding resource utilization and process optimization in a container terminal environment.
